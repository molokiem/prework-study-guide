# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## A study guide for course pre-work.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The study guide conatins notes on each topic we covered during our prework, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each topic's notes are separated in their own section. If we open the DevTools console, it will list the topics we learned from prework and can choose one topic for us to study first.
